# Cancer-Dataset
This was a problem statement where we had to determine wheter the type of cancer was benign or malignant. Dataset had few empty values in the column named 'Bare Nuclei', dropped the corresponding rows so as to remove any kind of noise. Two features had a very high value of correlation so dropped one of them. Features were mostly on a similar scale. Finally implemented a Support Vector Classifier with a gaussian kernel and the recall score found on a k fold cross validation tehnique was 1 and the f score was also 1.
